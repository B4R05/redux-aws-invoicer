# Installation 

For the server side:
- From your command line, cd into the 'server' folder
- Run 'npm install'
- After the modules have been installed, run the command 'node server.js' to run the server.


For the client side:
- From your command line, cd into the 'client' folder
- Run 'npm install' to install the required module dependencies
- Run 'npm start' to run the app.
- IMPORTANT: Only run the app on 'localhost:3000' as the backend will only accept requests from that point
