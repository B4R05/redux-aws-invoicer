# (NOTE: entire backend has migrated to AWS, mongo-express-node files are being deleted, styling being revamped and further updates being made. Ignore the rest of this README. Also feel free to use this project you wish!)

# Installation 

For the server side:
- From your command line, ```cd``` into the 'server' folder
- Run ```'npm install'```
- After the modules have been installed, run the command ```'node server.js'``` to run the server.


For the client side:
- From your command line, ```cd``` into the 'client' folder
- Run ```'npm install'``` to install the required module dependencies
- Run ```'npm start'``` to run the app.
- IMPORTANT: Only run the app on ```'localhost:3000'``` as the backend will only accept requests from that point

# Tests
- For both the client and server side tests, run ```'npm test'``` while your terminal is inside each
